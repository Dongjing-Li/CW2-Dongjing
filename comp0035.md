# Coursework 2

 Most students will use the same repository for coursework 2. You may use this file to present the results of that
 coursework if you wish. Alternatively you can use video or audio to provide the explanations instead of writing them.

 ## Requirements definition and analysis
 Functional requirements: 
 1. Create a new customer account;
 2. Support the search of meteorite information, such as name, classification and mass;
 3. Display the location of meteorites falling on a map;
 4. Provide predictions on where the meteorite will land;
 5. Export the desired data locally.

 Non-functional requirements:
 1. The web app can be supported by Chrome, Edge and Safari;
 2. The maximum loading time of the website should not exceed 3 seconds;
 3. Password requirement for the account, including length or special characters
 4. The maintenance time should carry out at midnight;
 5. The web app should function at any time.

 ### Requirements identification methods
 - Brainstorming: Generally, brainstorming is a group discussion centred on a theme, followed by another group discussion 
   to promote group creativity and arrive at the best solution. It is well suited for Scrum, the agile methodology. In Scrum, 
   the team holds a daily meeting, which is a great time for brainstorming to set the stage for the rest of the day's activities.
   However, since people will take turns to express their opinions, and other people should listen intently to what others 
   are saying. The rest of the people may be influenced to change their minds or forget what they wanted to say, leading
   to interruptions in their own thinking.


 - Interview: According to the Scrum principle, it is designed to enable teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and
   user needs which means it is necessary to collect feedback from users to improve the product. Interviews allow the interviewer
   to ask questions and get immediate input from the interviewee by setting up an online meeting or offline face-to-face
   communication. Although interviews tend to be time-consuming, it is still one of the most common ways to elicit requirements
   especially if the interview questions are well-prepared.
   

 - Prototyping: The primary aim of prototyping is to elicit and collect user requirement. Develop an early version of the 
   web app and present it to users to check whether the web app thus far appears to be satisfactory. Because the effective
   Scrum team is usually consists of five to seven members (1) and everyone is in different position. There may have a big
   disagreement during the brainstorming, and prototyping are usually built early in the development cycle. It is able to 
   improve team effectiveness when it complemented with brainstorming.
   

  - Final methods applied: Considering the ethics policy, interview is not applicable for the elicitation of requirments.
    Also, prototyping is also difficult to achieve because of time constraints. However, it can not be denied that these 
    two are very good methods under realistic conditions. Therefore, the final selected method will
    be brainstorming.
 
 ### Requirements specification method
   


 ### Prioritisation method


 ### Documented and prioritised requirements
 Link to the full list of documented and prioritised requirements.


 ## Design
 ### Structure and flow of the interface
 

 ### Relational database design

 ### Application structure


 ## Testing
 ### Choice of unit testing library

 ### Tests
 The tests should be in a separate and appropriately named file/directory.

 ### Test results
 Provide evidence that the tests have been run and the results of the tests (e.g. screenshot).

 ### Continuous integration (optional)
 Consider using GitHub Actions (or other) to establish a continuous integration pipeline. If you do so then please provide a link to the .yml and a screenshot of the results of a workflow run.\
